The ability to create funny, topical memes represents a minimal understanding of culture and a net novel content value add opportunity in the internet AI era.

We believe the simplicity of the automated_meme_function (input: headline_str, context_str; output: meme_img, meme_caption_str) lends itself to LLM fine-tuning and represents a sort of "live benchmark" with humans in the loop.

Once we figure out memes, we are not finished there. We want to use the same principles to build personality and a sense of self into LLMs as a stepping stone towards AGI agents.
